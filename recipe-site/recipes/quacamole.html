    <h3>
      How to Keep Guacamole From Turning<br />
      Brown
    </h3>
    <p>
      Avocados have a tendency to turn brown wheny are exposed to sir, so<br />
      guacamole looses its brightness rather quickly. You can prevent this by
      placing<br />
      the guacamole in an airtight container, then covering the top wiht a thin
      layer of<br />
      water, lemon juice or lime juice. THis barrier will keep the air from
      getting in.<br />
      Seal the container and store it in the refrigerator for up to two days.
    </p>
    <h2>Can You Freeze Guacamole?</h2>
    <p>
      Yes, you can freeze guacamole. Ladle it (in serving-size portions) into
      freezer<br />
      bags, squeeze out the excess air, and flatten. Wrap the bags in foil for
      extra<br />
      protection against freezer burn. Freeze for up to three months. Thaw in
      the<br />
      refrigerator.
