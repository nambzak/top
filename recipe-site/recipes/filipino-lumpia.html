    <h3>What is Lumpia?</h3>
    <p>
      Lumpia are fried spring rolls that are found in Filipino and Indonesian
      cuisines.<br />
      The rolls traditionally feature a thin pastry skin (a.k.a a lumpia
      wrapper) and are<br />
      often stuffed with a savoury mixture of ground pork and vegetables.

      <li>1 teaspoon garlic powder</li>

      <li>2 cups vegetable oil for frying, or as needed</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Directions</h3>
    <h4>Step 1</h4>
    <p>
      Heat 1 tablespoon vegetable oil in a wok or large skillet over high heat.
      Add<br />
      pork; cook and stir until crumbly and no pink is showing, 5 to 7 minutes.
      <br />
      Remove pork from the pan and set aside. Drain grease from the pan, leaving
      just<br />
      a thin coating.
    </p>
    <h4>Step 2</h4>
    <p>
      Add onion and garlic to the ban; cook and stir until fragrant, about 2
      minutes.<br />
      Stir in the cooked pork, carrots, green onions, cabbage, and cilantro.
      Season <br />
      with pepper, salt, garlic powder, and soy sauce. Remove from the heat, and
      set<br />
      aside until cool enough to handle, about 5 minutes.
    </p>
    <h4>Step 3</h4>
    <p>
      Assemble lumpia: Place 3 heaping tablespoons of filling diagnally near
      one<br />
      corner of a lumpia wrapper, leaving a 1 1/2 inch space at both ends. Fold
      the <br />
      side along the length of the filling over the filling, tuck in both ends,
      and roll<br />
      neatly and tightly to close. Moisten the other side of the wrapper with
      water to <br />
      seal the edge.Transfer to a place and cover with plastic wrap to retain
      moisture. <br />
      Repeat to assemble remaining lumpia.
    </p>
    <h4>Step 4</h4>
    <p>
      Heat 1/2 inch vegetable oil in a heavy skillet over medium heat for 5
      minutes.
    </p>
    <h4>Step 5</h4>
    <p>
      Slide 3 to 4 lumpia into the hot oil, making sure the seams are facing
      down. Fry, <br />
      turning occasionalyy, untill all sides are golden brown, 1 to 2 minutes.
      Transfer to <br />
      a paper towel-lined plate to drain. Repeaaaaat to fry remaining lumpia.
      Serve <br />
      immediately.
